# Course Introduction

Welcome! Dive deep into the intricate world of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) with our comprehensive course. This program is meticulously crafted to bridge the gap between traditional differential equations and the ever-evolving domain of neural networks. Perfect for those acquainted with machine learning and eager to apply these concepts to differential equations.

Our PINNs course will have live lectures, hands-on coding exercises, and quizzes designed for thorough self-assessment. 

Throughout your journey, our dedicated teaching team stands ready to guide and support, answering queries on our course discussion forum and during live online office hours.

To embark on this enlightening experience, simply fill out the sign-up form provided. Once your request is approved, an email containing further directions awaits you. Let's unravel the mysteries of PINNs together!

To make the learning experience enjoyable and engaging, we will be rewarding students who excel in completing quizzes/exercises and actively participate in the forum with special awards. On July 15, we will host a live session with the teaching staff to discuss progress, answer questions, and announce the mid-summer winners. These winners will receive exclusive Bedrock t-shirts. 

Lastly, on August 20th, we will hold the final Bedrock session, during which we will reveal the overall winners. The ultimate prize for the winners will be an exclusive dinner with the instructor at a location in Cambridge.



## Course Overview 

- Introduction to Differential Equations: Basic concepts, classifications, and real-world applications
- Numerical Methods for DE: Techniques to solve differential equations using computational algorithms
- Neural Networks and DE: Exploring NN-based methods for solving differential equations
- Setting Initial Conditions: Handling initial and boundary values 
- Optimization and Sampling: Dive into methods of optimization and various sampling techniques
- Transfer Learning for PINNs: Understand the application of transfer learning specifically in the PINNs realm
- Error Bounds and Uncertainty: Grasp the concepts of error bounds and how to quantify uncertainties in PINNs

It would be helpful to have a foundational understanding of differential equations and a basic grasp of neural network concepts. This course is tailored for those looking to refresh their understanding of advanced topics or to fill any gaps in prior knowledge. Those entirely new to differential equations or neural networks may find the pace a tad challenging, but remember, our support team is here to guide you every step of the way.

## Course Components

### Lessons

The learning materials for each topic are bundled. Lessons will help students develop the intuition for core concepts, providing the necessary mathematical background, guidance on technical details, and relevant examples. 

### Reading Assignments and Video Assignments 

Lessons include readings, lecture slides, and lecture videos. The goal of the reading is to prepare you for the lesson content, familiarize you with new terminology and definitions, and to help you determine which part of the subject may need more attention. 

Each session may have a short 'reading check' at the beginning which covers the assigned reading for that week. This will help assess your understanding of the material.

### Quizzes & Exercises

Most lessons also include exercises and quizzes. Quizzes are for self-assessment. The exercises can be attempted as many times as you wish.

## Course Policies

### Getting Help

For questions about the course content, after you have tried to troubleshoot yourselves, the process to get help is:

- Post the question on the course discussion forum. Note that forum posts are visible to everyone. The teaching staff monitors the posts. You are encouraged to answer your peers' questions! üòÅ 
- Attend an online office hour (schedule TBD).

### Diversity and Inclusion Statement

We actively seek and welcome people of diverse identities, from across the spectrum of disciplines and methods since Artificial Intelligence (AI) increasingly mediates our social, cultural, economic, and political interactions [1]. 

We believe in creating and maintaining an inclusive learning environment where all members feel safe, respected, and capable of producing their best work. 

We commit to an experience for all participants that is free from -- Harassment, bullying, and discrimination which includes but is not limited to:

- Offensive comments related to age, race, religion, creed, color, gender (including transgender/gender identity/gender expression), sexual orientation, medical condition, physical or intellectual disability, pregnancy, or medical conditions, national origin or ancestry.
- Intimidation, personal attacks, harassment, unnecessary disruption of talks during any of the learning activities.
