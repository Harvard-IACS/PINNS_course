To optimize your workshop experience, it is beneficial to have familiarity with mathematical notation for multidimensional objects such as vectors, matrices, and tensors. While a deep understanding of linear algebra is not required, having a grasp of how vectors represent direction and magnitude, as well as basic operations involving vectors and matrices, will be advantageous.

Knowing where to begin is crucial in reaching your destination, and we are here to assist you in planning those initial steps and maximizing your Bedrock data science experience.

Although Bedrock assumes minimal programming knowledge and will cover fundamental concepts like variables, operators, and functions, you can enhance your understanding of the series by briefly reviewing the topics listed below.



### Vectors, Matrics, and Tensors

- "Vectors: Essence of Linear Algebra" by 3Blue1Brown ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNk_zzaMoSs&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab&index=2))
- "So... What actually is a Matrix?: Data Science Basics" by ritvikmath ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEQ6j0eRDtg))
- "Matrix Operations" by patrickJMT ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFApWAl3NJw))
- "What's a Tensor?" by Dan Fleisch ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5liqUk0ZTw))

### Mathematical Notation

Appreciating many of the examples presented in this series will require familiarity with sigma notation and subscripting of variables. You can brush up on the basics and then use the practice examples from MIT OpenCourseWare to test your skills.

- "Subscripts in Mathematics" by Always Learning ([YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOi1UOkj_ik)
- "Sigma Notation Introduction" by Kirk Taylor ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQZY4pD8X6I))
- "Summation Notation Practice" by MIT OpenCourseWare ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHErQuZ8M-I))

### Calculus

During the final days of the series weâ€™ll be using some calculus. The concept of a derivative will be reintroduced and briefly defined, and you'll then be using a few basic calculus rules (and vector/matrix operations described earlier) to optimize your machine learning model. Reviewing the idea of a derivative and some basic derivative rules might help reduce math anxiety (and give you a leg up on working on your models).
